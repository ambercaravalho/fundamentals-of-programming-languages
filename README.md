# Fundamentals of Programming Languages (Projects)
Welcome to the Fundamentals of Programming Languages repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of code examples from the course taken at The University of Arizona Global Campus. The course aims to provide students with a solid foundation in computer programming using the Python language.

## Course Description
The Fundamentals of Programming Languages course covers a wide range of essential topics related to computer programming. Students delve into the study of primitive data types, expressions, control statements, functions, and arrays. Throughout the course, Python, a powerful high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, and dynamic programming language, is utilized as the primary language for instruction.

## Course Contents
This repository encompasses an extensive collection of code examples and projects, meticulously organized on a week-by-week basis. The code examples are thoughtfully categorized into folders, each representing a specific week of the course. Within each folder, you will find all completed projects corresponding to the respective week's coursework.

## Getting Started
