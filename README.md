# Fundamentals of Programming Languages (Projects)
Welcome to the Fundamentals of Programming Languages repository! This repository contains all the code examples from the course taken at The University of Arizona Global Campus. The course is designed to introduce students to the basics of computer programming using Python.
## Course Description
The Fundamentals of Programming Languages course covers a range of topics related to computer programming. Students will learn about primitive data types, expressions, control statements, functions, and arrays. The course uses Python, a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, and dynamic programming language.
## Course Contents
The repository contains code examples and projects for each week of the course (week one through week five). The examples are organized into folders for each week, with each folder containing all completed projects from those weeks.
## Getting Started
To get started with the examples, clone the repository to your local machine. You will need to have Python installed on your machine to run the examples. Once you have Python installed, navigate to the folder containing the example you want to run and execute the Python file.
